What is Trellis Desk?
---------------------

Trellis Desk is a powerful and robust help desk solution for your business.
Improve your company's service by allowing your customers to quickly and easily
submit support tickets to your team.  Trellis Desk sports a range of advanced
features that enable your business to handle customer support more efficiently.
Plus, it's completely free â€“ you'll never have to pay any license fees to use
Trellis Desk.


Status
------

Trellis Desk 2.0 is under heavy development and not recommended for a production
environment.  With the help of user contributions and the support of the
community, we hope to have a stable, documented release by the end of 2011.


Requirements
------------

* PHP 5.3
* MySQL 4.1
* GD2 + FreeType (for some CAPTCHA support)


Installation
------------

Trellis Desk 2.0 is in an early development stage.  We strongly recommend
against using Trellis Desk 2.0 in a production environment.  To install, simply
upload all files to your web server, point your browser to the *install*
directory, and follow the on-screen instructions.


Why Open Source?
----------------

Trellis Desk has traditionally been developed in our spare time, which makes it
rather difficult to release new versions on a reliable schedule. Our customers
have been clamoring for more frequent updates or the ability to merge their own
fixes and additions into the codebase. We are open-sourcing this product because
we want to see it continue to grow and thrive with the help of the community,
rather than be hampered by limited resources.


Plan
--------

To be completed.


Contributing
------------

To be completed.

In all honesty, many will find the Trellis Desk 2.0 code unorganized.  Many of
the code originates from over two years ago before I (DJ Tarazona) had a deep
understanding of Object-Oriented Programming.  Each time I contribute to Trellis
Desk, I have a desire to reorganize the code into an MVC architecture.  At this
time, I feel that task may be better suited for (dare I say?) Trellis Desk 3.
However if anyone wants to take a whack at it -- be my guest!
