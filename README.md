In all honesty, many will find the Trellis Desk 2.0 code unorganized.  Many of
the code originates from over two years ago before I (DJ Tarazona) had a deep
understanding of Object-Oriented Programming.  Each time I contribute to Trellis
Desk, I have a desire to reorganize the code into an MVC architecture.  At this
time, I feel that task may be better suited for (dare I say?) Trellis Desk 3.
However if anyone wants to take a whack at it -- be my guest!
