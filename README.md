Trellis Desk
============

What is Trellis Desk?
---------------------

Trellis Desk is a powerful and robust help desk solution for your business.
Improve your company's service by allowing your customers to quickly and easily
submit support tickets to your team.  Trellis Desk sports a range of advanced
features that enable your business to handle customer support more efficiently.
Plus, it's completely free â€“ you'll never have to pay any license fees to use
Trellis Desk.


Status
------

Trellis Desk 2.0 is under heavy development and not recommended for a production
environment.  With the help of user contributions and the support of the
community, we hope to have a stable, documented release by the end of 2011.


Requirements
------------

* PHP 5.3
* MySQL 4.1
* GD2 + FreeType (for some CAPTCHA support)


Installation
------------

Trellis Desk 2.0 is in an early development stage.  We strongly recommend
against using Trellis Desk 2.0 in a production environment.  To install, simply
upload all files to your web server, point your browser to the *install*
directory, and follow the on-screen instructions.


Why Open Source?
----------------

Trellis Desk has traditionally been developed in our spare time, which makes it
rather difficult to release new versions on a reliable schedule. Our customers
have been clamoring for more frequent updates or the ability to merge their own
fixes and additions into the codebase. We are open-sourcing this product because
we want to see it continue to grow and thrive with the help of the community,
rather than be hampered by limited resources.


Plan
--------

Let's get the ACP (backend) as closed to finished as possible before working on
the frontend.  We're almost there!

The frontend needs a good amount of work.  It's using a lot of old code from
Trellis Desk 1.0.  Let's not worry about looks right now.  Focus on
functionality.  We'll skin it up all nice and pretty later.

In all honesty, many will find the Trellis Desk 2.0 code unorganized.  Many of
the code originates from over two years ago before I (DJ Tarazona) had a deep
understanding of Object-Oriented Programming.  Each time I contribute to Trellis
Desk, I have a desire to reorganize the code into an MVC architecture.  At this
time, I feel that task may be better suited for (dare I say?) Trellis Desk 3.
However if anyone wants to take a whack at it -- be my guest!
